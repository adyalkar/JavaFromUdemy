1.Dynamic Resizing: ArrayList is a dynamic array implementation, which means it automatically 
resizes itself to accommodate more elements as needed. This makes it convenient for adding and 
removing elements without worrying about managing the underlying array size.

2.Ordered Collection: ArrayList maintains the order in which elements are added. 
The order is preserved when iterating through the list.

3.Duplicates Allowed: ArrayList allows duplicate elements. You can have multiple occurrences of 
the same element in the list.

4.Index-Based Access: You can access elements in an ArrayList using their index. 
The index starts from 0 for the first element and goes up to size() - 1 for the last element.

5.Fast Random Access: Retrieving an element by index (get(index)) in an ArrayList is very fast, 
as it directly accesses the underlying array.

6.Adding and Removing Elements: Adding elements to the end of the list (add(element)) is efficient. 
However, adding or removing elements from the middle or beginning of the list can be less efficient, 
as it may require shifting elements to maintain the order.

7.Iterating through Elements: You can iterate through the elements of an ArrayList using various 
methods, such as the enhanced for loop (for-each), iterator, or Java Streams.

8.Methods for Manipulation: ArrayList provides a variety of methods for adding, removing, searching, 
and manipulating elements, including add, remove, clear, contains, indexOf, and more.

9.Null Elements: ArrayList allows storing null elements.

10.Capacity and Performance: ArrayList has a default initial capacity. 
If the number of elements exceeds the capacity, the list's capacity is automatically increased, 
which may involve creating a new larger array and copying elements. 
You can set an initial capacity explicitly using the constructor.

11.Thread-Safety: ArrayList is not synchronized, which means it's not thread-safe for concurrent 
access. If multiple threads can modify the same ArrayList instance, consider using thread-safe 
alternatives like CopyOnWriteArrayList.

12.Wrapper Classes: ArrayList stores elements of reference types, so primitive types need to be 
wrapped using their corresponding wrapper classes (e.g., Integer for int, Double for double, etc.).

13.Performance Trade-Off: While ArrayList provides fast random access, it may not be the best 
choice for frequent insertions and deletions. In such cases, consider using other list 
implementations like LinkedList.

14.Choosing the Right List Implementation: Depending on your specific use case and requirements, 
you might need to consider other implementations of the List interface, such as LinkedList, 
which is optimized for frequent insertions and deletions.

Remember that understanding the characteristics and behaviors of ArrayList will help you make 
informed decisions when choosing data structures for your Java programs.
