The toString() method is a built-in method in Java that belongs to the Object class, 
the root class for all classes in Java.

When you call toString() on an object, it returns a string that represents the object's state. By default, the toString() method 
returns a string that includes the class name and a unique identifier of the object 
in the form of the object's hash code.
Ex: _4_OOPS_Advanced._1_Fan@3d012ddd

However, it is common practice to override the toString() method in your own classes 
to provide a meaningful and human-readable representation of the object's state. 
This can be helpful for debugging and displaying object information in a readable 
format.

public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person: Name=" + name + ", Age=" + age;
    }
}
