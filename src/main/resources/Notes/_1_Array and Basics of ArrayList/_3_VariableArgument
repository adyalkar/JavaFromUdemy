Variable arguments, also known as varargs, allow you to pass a variable number of arguments of the same
type to a method. In Java, variable arguments are denoted by the ellipsis (...) after the parameter type 
in the method declaration. This feature was introduced in Java 5.

The method can be called with different numbers of arguments, making it flexible to handle various 
scenarios where the number of inputs may vary.

It's important to note that varargs should be the last parameter in a method's parameter list. 
Additionally, a method can have at most one varargs parameter.

public class VarargsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printNumbers(1, 2, 3);           // Calling the method with three arguments
        printNumbers(4, 5);              // Calling the method with two arguments
        printNumbers(6, 7, 8, 9, 10);     // Calling the method with five arguments
    }

    public static void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
