An array is a data structure in Java that allows you to store multiple values of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory.
Arrays provide a way to efficiently organize and access collections of related data.

Here are some key points about arrays:

1. Declaration and Initialization: 
 You declare an array by specifying the data type of its elements followed
 by square brackets [], and then provide a name for the array variable. You can initialize the array with 
 specific values using an initializer list or allocate memory dynamically using the new keyword.
 
 // Declaration and initialization of an integer array
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Declaration and dynamic initialization of a string array
String[] names = new String[3];
names[0] = "John";
names[1] = "Jane";
names[2] = "Bob";
 
 2.Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, which is determined at the time of declaration or initialization. 
 Once the size is set, it cannot be changed. You can access elements of an array using their index, 
 starting from 0.
 
 int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element
String secondName = names[1]; // Accessing the second element
 
 3. Length: You can determine the length of an array using the length property, which gives the total 
 number of elements in the array.
 
 int arrayLength = numbers.length; // Length of the numbers array
 
4. Iteration: Arrays can be iterated using loops like for or foreach, allowing you to access and 
manipulate each element in the array. 

// Iterating over the elements of the numbers array
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}

// Iterating using foreach loop
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}

5.Multidimensional Arrays: Java supports multidimensional arrays, allowing you to create arrays with 
multiple dimensions or levels.

// Declaration and initialization of a 2D array
int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

// Accessing elements of a 2D array
int element = matrix[1][2]; // Accessing the element at row 1, column 2

 Arrays are widely used in Java to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.
 They provide a convenient way to access individual elements and perform operations on groups of related 
 values.
