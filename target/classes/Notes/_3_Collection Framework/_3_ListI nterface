The List interface is a subinterface of the Collection interface in the Java Collections Framework. 
It represents an ordered collection of elements where duplicate elements are allowed. 
Lists maintain the order in which elements are added and provide methods to access elements by 
their index. Here's an overview of the List interface:

public interface List<E> extends Collection<E> {
    // Positional Access Operations
    E get(int index);
    E set(int index, E element);
    void add(int index, E element);
    E remove(int index);

    // Search Operations
    int indexOf(Object o);
    int lastIndexOf(Object o);

    // List Iterators
    ListIterator<E> listIterator();
    ListIterator<E> listIterator(int index);

    // View Sublists
    List<E> subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex);
}

Key points about the List interface:
-------------------------------------------------------
Ordered Collection: Lists maintain the order in which elements are added. Elements can be accessed and manipulated based on their position (index) in the list.

Index-Based Access: Lists provide methods to access elements by their index:

1.get(index): Retrieves the element at the specified index.
2.set(index, element): Replaces the element at the specified index with the given element.
3.add(index, element): Inserts the specified element at the specified index.
4.remove(index): Removes and returns the element at the specified index.
5.Search Operations: Lists offer methods to find the index of the first occurrence (indexOf) and 
last occurrence (lastIndexOf) of a specified element.

6.List Iterators: List iterators allow bidirectional traversal of a list's elements. 
They provide methods to traverse forward and backward and to modify elements while iterating.

7.Sublists: The subList(fromIndex, toIndex) method returns a view of the portion of the list 
between the specified fromIndex (inclusive) and toIndex (exclusive). 
Changes to the sublist are reflected in the original list and vice versa.

The List interface is implemented by various classes, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector,
 each offering different characteristics and performance trade-offs. 
 When working with lists, you can perform operations specific to lists, such as getting, setting,
  adding, and removing elements at specific positions.
