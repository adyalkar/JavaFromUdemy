Abstract classes and interfaces are both essential components of object-oriented programming 
in Java, but they have distinct purposes and characteristics. Here are the key differences 
between abstract classes and interfaces:

1. Purpose:

Abstract Class: An abstract class is designed to serve as a blueprint for subclasses. 
It can contain both abstract and concrete methods. Abstract classes are used when you want to 
define a common base class with some shared behavior and leave certain methods to be implemented
 by its subclasses.
Interface: An interface is used to define a contract that classes must adhere to. It contains 
only abstract methods (and optionally, default and static methods in recent Java versions) 
without any method bodies. Interfaces are used to establish a common set of methods that 
unrelated classes can implement, promoting code flexibility and multiple inheritance.

2.Method Implementation:

Abstract Class: An abstract class can have abstract methods (without implementations) as well as
concrete methods (with implementations). Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for 
the abstract methods, but they can also inherit and use the concrete methods from the abstract 
class.
Interface: An interface can only have abstract methods without implementations. Classes that 
implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods 
declared in the interface.

3.Inheritance:

Abstract Class: Java supports single inheritance for classes. A class can extend only one 
abstract class, limiting the possibilities of extending multiple base classes.
Interface: Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. A class can implement multiple 
interfaces, allowing it to inherit and implement multiple sets of behaviors.

4.Access Modifiers:

Abstract Class: Abstract classes can have access modifiers like public, protected, private, or 
package-private (default), allowing you to control the visibility of the members within the 
class hierarchy.
Interface: Interface members are implicitly public and are always accessible to the implementing 
classes.

5.Constructors:

Abstract Class: Abstract classes can have constructors, and these constructors are called when 
an object of a subclass is created. Abstract classes can also have instance variables.
Interface: Interfaces cannot have constructors or instance variables; they only declare 
abstract methods and, optionally, constants (constant fields).

6.Instance Creation:

Abstract Class: You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. It needs to be 
extended by a concrete subclass, and objects are created using the concrete subclass.
Interface: You cannot create an instance of an interface directly. Instead, you create objects 
of classes that implement the interface.

7.Version Compatibility:

Abstract Class: When adding new methods to an abstract class, existing subclasses may not have
 to implement these new methods if they are not marked as abstract. This can help maintain 
 backward compatibility.
Interface: When adding new methods to an interface, all classes that implement the interface must
 provide concrete implementations for the new methods. This may cause backward compatibility 
 issues if existing classes do not implement the new methods.
 
 
In summary, abstract classes are used to model a common base class with both shared and 
unimplemented behaviors, while interfaces are used to define contracts for unrelated classes 
to implement. Both have their distinct use cases, and the choice between using an abstract 
class or an interface depends on the specific design goals and requirements of your program.
